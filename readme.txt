# Resume CLI Generator

A simple, extensible command-line tool to build professional PDF resumes from structured JSON data. Includes interactive editing, AI-powered text-to-JSON conversion, and customizable templatesâ€”ideal for software engineers, security specialists, and contractors.

## Features

- **JSON-driven**: Keep your personal, skills, projects, education, and certifications data in `/data/*.json`.
- **PDF Output**: One-command resume generation (`--generate`) produces a polished `resume.pdf`.
- **Interactive Editing**: Update any section on the fly (`--update`).
- **AI Enrichment**: Convert free-text into structured JSON via OpenAI or Hugging Face (`--section`).
- **Modular & Extendable**: Plug in custom templates or data sources to suit your workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `reportlab` for PDF generation
- (Optional) `openai` or `requests` for AI integration

```bash
pip install reportlab openai requests
````

### Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-cli.git
   cd resume-cli
   ```

2. **Populate data files**
   Place your JSON files in the `/data` directory:

   * `personal.json`
   * `skills.json`
   * `projects.json`
   * `education.json`
   * `certs.json`

   You can use the provided placeholders as a starting point.

3. **Configure AI (optional)**

   * For OpenAI: set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment.
   * For Hugging Face: set `HF_API_TOKEN`.

### Usage

```bash
# 1. Interactive update of all sections
python resume_cli.py --update

# 2. Generate the PDF resume
python resume_cli.py --generate

# 3. Convert free-text into JSON (e.g. personal section)
python resume_cli.py --section personal \
    --text "Alex Morgan, a cybersecurity engineer with expertise..." \
    --api openai
```

## Customization

* **Templates**: Swap out or extend `draw_paragraph` and layout code in `resume_cli.py` to adjust styling.
* **New Sections**: Add new JSON files and rendering blocks for certifications, languages, or publications.
* **Output Formats**: Integrate other Python PDF or document-generation libraries for Word or HTML exports.
